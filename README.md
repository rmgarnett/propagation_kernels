Propagation Kernels
===================

A MATLAB implementation of the propagation graph kernel described in:

> Neumann, M. Patricia, N., Garnett, R., and Kersting, K. Efficient
> Graph Kernels by Randomization. (2013). Machine Learning and
> Knowledge Discovery in Databases: European Conference (ECML/PKDD
> 2012), pp. 378--392.

This implementation supports arbitrary user-defined base kernels and
transformations.

Usage
-----

Add the directory to your MATLAB path and use `help
propagation_kernel` to view the documentation. A simple demo is
provided in the `demo/` directory.
